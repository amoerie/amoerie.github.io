Hi, I'm Alexander Moerman.

I'm a software developer based in Belgium. I enjoy exploring programming languages, patterns, and the occasional deep dive into framework internals.

This blog is where I share my thoughts and experiments in software development - mostly C# and .NET, but occasionally venturing into other territories.
